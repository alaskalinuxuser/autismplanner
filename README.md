# Autism Planner

A planning app designed for people with ASS

## Why?

I tried many apps to deal with my daily schedule and in my experience they all have way too many features. Many of them show way too many information. In my experience the most relaxing way of planning tasks is to just plan tasks for Today and Tomorrow and Later. More stuff like that is just unnecessary clutter. Another thing i do is only show 1 list of tasks at a time, nobody needs to deal with what is going on tomorrow or later. After a task is done you can tab once to mark it as done or tab two times to remove the task completely(Again i don't like clutter).
