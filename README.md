# Autism Planner(discontinued)

A planning app designed for people with ASS

## I discontinued the ubports app
I tried to use ubports on several devices for years, but in the end i really have to conclude that ubports suffered from regressions almost every OTA and there seems to be a lack of testing all across the board. I tried a few devices that should be daily driver ready but at the end of the day the user experience is terrible and does not seem to improve at all. I know the ubports community is working and put their heart and soul in it but it seems like there is more work than people available to do the job. I wish them all the best and i really hope the transition to 20.04 fixes a lot of current issues. But for now i move on to something else. 

## Maybe a sailfish app
I don't consider android an option so i move to sailfish X because it seems to have improved a lot lately and has always been a lot more stable in the past. So i might consider a Sailfish app if i don't find an usable app. If there already is an usable app that fits my workflow i consider this project cancelled.

## Why?

I tried many apps to deal with my daily schedule and in my experience they all have way too many features. Many of them show way too many information. In my experience the most relaxing way of planning tasks is to just plan tasks for Today and Tomorrow and Later. More stuff like that is just unnecessary clutter. Another thing i do is only show 1 list of tasks at a time, nobody needs to deal with what is going on tomorrow or later. After a task is done you can tab once to mark it as done or tab two times to remove the task completely(Again i don't like clutter).
